- For the Crop Production, we drew conclusion that out of 29 states and 7 Union territories, we found out top 5 charting states that had the highest crop production.
- For the Crop Data, we visualized the average modal price vs commodity categories and found out that the different commodities with highest average modal price and finally predicted modal price using **RandomForestRegressor**. Lastly we created a model with accuracy score of 74.8% ✨
